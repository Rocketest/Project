<h1> History </h1>
<pre>
Potatoes were first cultivated around 8000 years ago in South America's Andes mountain range by ancient Peruvians.

Benjamin Franklin is credited for discovering electricity in the 1700s with his kite experiment, in which he flew a kite with a metal key tied to it during a thunderstorm.

The potato battery was discovered by Luigi Galvani in 1780 when he connected two metals (zinc and copper) to the legs of a frog and a potato, causing its muscles to twitch.

<h1> Science Facts </h1>
<pre>
The acid inside the potato forms a chemical reaction with the zinc and copper, and when the electrons flow from one material to another, energy is released.

What the potato does is simply help conduct electricity by acting as whatâ€™s called a salt-bridge between the the two metals, allowing the electron current to move freely across the wire to create electricity. Numerous fruits rich in electrolytes like bananas and strawberries can also form this chemical reaction. They're basically natural bat
acid batteries.

<center> Potatoes:- The Saviors of the World! </center>
<pre>
When the times were dark,
For ancient Africa,
Of no help were,
Suffering Europe and Asia.

Food was scarce,
And hard to grow,
And due to hunger,
Many lives even had to go!

The rice, wheat and millets,
Demanded good soil and sun,
Giving them <i>just</i> enough water,
Was also a hurdle for everyone!

Then came the 16th century,
And the first potatoes,
This yummy veggie fed everyone's stomachs,
And had farmers easliy had more crops to grow.

Without these today-underated brown little things,
Modernization wouldn't get its wings,
Dear audience, you possibly couldn't
Expect to not be famished either, of COURSE you wouldn't!
